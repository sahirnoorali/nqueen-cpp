# Solving N-Queen Problem

This code solves the N Queen puzzle which is just an extension of 8 Queen Puzzle. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle)

It searches in a recursive manner to find a state where all queens can be placed in the chess board without anyone beating the other.
Since it's a recursive algorithm, it also has a backtracking feature to undo the wrong attempts of finding a solution. The code ultimately
outputs the solution found on the console. Note that 'n' is defined in the very top of the code as directive.
